# What Do We Do!
BubbleMathics is a cute, educational app designed for young students. It offers a competitive platform where kids can compete against each other in math challenges. The app includes:

- Math problems in addition, subtraction, and multiplication.
- A leaderboard to track who has the most points in the session, with different ranks.
- A waiting room where students can wait for others to join before starting a game (minimum of 3 students required).
- A competitive, Kahoot-like platform where kids can answer questions and earn points.
- User authentication using PropelAuth for secure login and account management.
